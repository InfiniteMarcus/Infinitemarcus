# About me

## 🤔 - Who I am

I'm a Computer Science student at the Federal University of São Carlos (UFSCar) - Campus Sorocaba. I am also part of the organization of the extension activity and hackerspace HackoonSpace, at the same university.

## 💻 - Working status

I'm currently working on updating my [Monika bot repository](https://github.com/Infinitemarcus/Monika-bot) with new commands and good programming practices. This is my first Node.js project, so I still need to learn somethings.

## ⏳ - Next project

In future, I wish to work with a new 2D videogame in [Godot engine](https://godotengine.org/). 

If you want to see my first gaming project (where I participated as programmer and game designer), access this game/demo: [In Their Eyes](https://infinitemarcus.itch.io/in-their-eyes).

## 🤓 - What I like

I like to work with technologies and programming languages such as:
* Arduino
* Discord bots (mainly with [Discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js)
* C/C++/C#
* Game development in general
* PHP
* Java
* Javascript (currently studying Node.js)
* SQL
Etc

I also like video games, anime, and many other things. In my free time, I do a little bit of everything 😄
